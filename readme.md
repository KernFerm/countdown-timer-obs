# Bubbles The Dev - Countdown Timer with Sound

A Python-based countdown timer built using Pygame and Tkinter. This application allows users to adjust the timer, import sound files (`.mp3` or `.wav`), and play a sound when the timer reaches 30 seconds. The interface is user-friendly and includes buttons to start, stop, increase, decrease, and reset the timer.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```
git clone https://github.com/KernFerm/countdown-timer-obs.git
cd countdown-timer-obs
```

2. **Install dependencies**: Install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install pygame
```
```
pip install tk
```

3. **Run the script**: Once dependencies are installed, run the script using Python:

```
python main.py
```

## Usage
- **Adjust Timer**: Use the `+10 sec` and `-10 sec` buttons to increase or decrease the countdown time.
- **Start/Stop Timer**: Use the `Start` button to start the countdown, and the `Stop` button to pause it.
- **Import Sound**: Use the `Import Sound` button to select a `.mp3` or `.wav` file that will play when the timer reaches 30 seconds.
- **Clear Timer**: Use the `Clear Timer` button to reset the timer to 60 seconds.

## Example
When running the script, the interface will display:

- A countdown timer.
- Buttons to adjust the timer, start/stop it, import a sound, and reset the timer.
- Information about the selected sound file.

## Timer Controls
-------------------------
| Button        | Description                              |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| +10 sec       | Increases the countdown timer by 10 sec  |
| -10 sec       | Decreases the countdown timer by 10 sec  |
| Start         | Starts the countdown timer               |
| Stop          | Pauses the countdown timer               |
| Import Sound  | Imports a .mp3 or .wav sound file        |
| Clear Timer   | Resets the timer to 60 seconds           |
----------------

## Code Overview

### Timer Functionality

- The countdown timer updates every second. You can increase or decrease the time using the buttons:
```
# Increase the timer by 10 seconds
duration += 10

# Decrease the timer by 10 seconds, ensuring it doesn't go below 0
duration = max(0, duration - 10)
```

## Sound Import
You can import `.mp3` or `.wav` files. The sound will play when the timer reaches 30 seconds:

```
selected_file = filedialog.askopenfilename(
    title="Select Sound File",
    filetypes=AUDIO_FILE_TYPES
)
```

- If the selected sound file's duration is longer than 2 minutes, an error message will appear:

```
if duration > 120:
    messagebox.showerror("Invalid File", "The file exceeds 2 minutes.")
```

## Configuration (`config.py`)

- Here are the configuration settings used in the program:

```
# Configurations for Countdown Timer Application

# Timer settings
ALERT_DURATION = 30  # When to play sound (in seconds)

# Sound settings
SOUND_VOLUME = 0.26

# File dialog settings
AUDIO_FILE_TYPES = [("Audio Files", "*.mp3 *.wav")]

# Frame settings
FPS = 30  # Frames per second for the Pygame clock
```
